AngularJS uses MVC Architecture in its approach to create web application.

MVC Architecture is a programming methodology which aims to split out application 
up into three core components: models, views and controllers.
These three combine to from the application

* Model 
- data that we work with
- can be any type of data like from json or from database

* View 
- is a html template which represent a certain view or state in your application
- used to display content and data to a user in a browser
- use expression to insert data into views <html tag>{{data}}</html tag>

* Controllers 
- interaction between the models and view
- control the functionality of our views
- performs the interaction between our models and our views
- different controllers for different areas in our application 

An example using the MVC approach:
User click a 'show user' button in a view. The 'UserController' recognises the button 
click event and performs a function. The function communicates with the 'users' model 
and retrieves all the user data. The controller passes accessibility to this data to 
the view, which then displays it to the end user via expressions
